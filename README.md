# Smartphone-Based-Recognition

Here the purpose is to predict humans postures with data collected by several sensors from a smartphone. The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities: 

- Three static postures
- Three dynamic activities 
- Six postural transitions

Some preprocessing was done on the data to generate more features. At the end each records is composed from 561 integer features.
